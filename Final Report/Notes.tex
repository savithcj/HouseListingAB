Django is a framework, not a language. Python is the language in which Django is written.

Django is a collection of Python libs allowing you to quickly and efficiently create a quality Web application, and is suitable for both frontend and backend.

However, Django is pretty famous for its "Django admin", an auto generated backend that allows you to manage you website in a blink for a lot of simple use cases without having to code much.

More precisely, for the front end, Django helps you with data selection, formating and display. It features URL management, a templating language, authentification mechanisme, cache hooks and various navigation tools such as paginators.

For the backend, Django comes with an ORM that let you manipulate your data source with ease, forms (an HTML independant implementation) to process user input and validate data and signals, a n implementation of the observer pattern. Plus a tons of use case specific nifty little tools.

For all the rest of the backend work Django doesn't help with, you just use regular Python. Business logic is a pretty broad term.

You probably want to know as well that Django comes with the concept of apps, a self contain pluggable Django library that solves a problem. The Django community is huge, and so there are numerous apps that do specific business logic that vanilla Django doesn't.

Permissions
In this tutorial, we'll show you how to allow users to log in to your site with their own accounts, and how to control what they can do and see based on whether or not they are logged in and their permissions. As part of this demonstration, we'll extend the LocalLibrary website, adding login and logout pages, and user- and staff-specific pages for viewing books that have been borrowed.
